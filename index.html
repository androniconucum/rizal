            <h3>Rizal's Daily Practice</h3>
            <p>
              Rizal combined intellectual discipline with community service. He wrote before
              dawn, treated patients in Dapitan, ran a small school, and experimented on
              agriculture. His insistence on civic education and moral reform empowered Filipinos
              to see themselves as a nation ready for self-rule.

            <p>
              Bonifacio balanced day jobs with clandestine meetings, arming chapters and
              translating revolutionary ideas into action plans. He nurtured solidarity through
              rituals, coded messages, and training drills that prepared members for collective
              uprising.
